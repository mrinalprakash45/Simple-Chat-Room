# Simple-Chat-Room
Simple Chat Room using Python

## Description
Setting up a Simple Chat Room server and allow multiple clients to connect to it using a client-side script using Python

## Getting Started
* We will require two scripts to establish this chat room. One to keep the serving running, and another that every client should run in order to connect to the server.
* We would require any requests that come to the public IP addresses to be re-routed towards our private IP address in our local network, and would hence require port forwarding.
